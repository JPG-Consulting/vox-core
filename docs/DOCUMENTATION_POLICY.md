# DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md

## Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory rules and safety constraints** for writing, modifying, and maintaining documentation in the Vox Core project.

It exists to:
- prevent accidental loss of specification detail
- prevent unsafe or ambiguous documentation changes
- ensure consistency when using AI-assisted development
- protect the project from silent regressions caused by rewriting or summarization

This policy is **normative**.  
Violations of this policy are considered **blocking issues**, not stylistic concerns.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- all files under `docs/`
- any document declared *authoritative* by `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
- all documentation changes proposed or generated by humans or AI tools

This policy does **not** apply to:
- temporary notes
- experimental drafts
- non-authoritative examples clearly marked as such

---

## Definitions

### Authoritative Document
A document that defines system behavior, constraints, data models, or rules.

Examples:
- `SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`
- `DATA_MODELS.md`
- `STATE_MACHINES.md`

Authoritative documents define **what the system is allowed to do**.

### Non-Authoritative Document
A document used for orientation, planning, or explanation.

Examples:
- `README.md`
- `TODO.md`

Non-authoritative documents MUST NOT override authoritative ones.

---

## Core Principles

### DOC-1: Documentation Is Executable Design

Documentation in Vox Core is **not descriptive prose**.

It is treated as:
- a specification
- a constraint system
- a source of truth for humans and AI

Deleting or altering documentation is equivalent to deleting or altering code.

---

## Change Control Rules

### DOC-2: Additive-Only Rule (CRITICAL)

Authoritative documentation MUST NOT be rewritten from scratch.

By default, all changes MUST be:
- additive
- explicit
- localized

Allowed changes:
- adding new sections
- adding new subsections
- extending existing sections with clearly separated text

Forbidden changes:
- rewriting entire files
- paraphrasing existing text
- “cleaning up” or shortening content
- regenerating files from summaries or memory

> **File size shrinking is a red flag and MUST be investigated.**

---

### DOC-3: No Silent Deletions

Removing or modifying existing authoritative content is a **breaking change**.

Breaking documentation changes:
- MUST be intentional
- MUST be explicitly documented
- MUST be recorded in the document’s change log

Silent deletions are forbidden.

---

### DOC-4: No Reconstruction from Memory

Documentation MUST NOT be regenerated based on:
- recollection
- summaries
- inferred equivalence
- “this means the same thing”

All changes MUST be applied to the **existing text**, not a reconstructed version.

---

## Language & Style Rules

### DOC-5: Normative Language Only

Authoritative documents MUST:
- use neutral, formal language
- use MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD where applicable
- avoid conversational tone
- avoid storytelling or narrative examples

---

### DOC-6: No Personal Names or Dialogue

Authoritative documentation MUST NOT:
- reference real or fictional people
- include conversational dialogue
- use example names

Instead, use abstract terms such as:
- profile owner
- requesting user
- third party
- speaker
- target user

Examples, if necessary, MUST be:
- clearly marked as NON-NORMATIVE
- placed in non-authoritative documents only

---

## Cross-Document Integrity

### DOC-7: Consistency Requirement

If a change affects concepts defined in multiple documents:
- all affected documents MUST be updated
- cross-references MUST remain correct

`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` MUST always accurately reflect:
- the document set
- their relationships
- their authority level

---

## AI-Assisted Development Rules

### DOC-8: AI Output Guardrails

When using AI to modify documentation:

The AI MUST be instructed to:
- never rewrite full files
- propose **additive changes only**
- specify exact insertion points
- avoid paraphrasing existing text

If AI output is ambiguous, destructive, or reconstructive:
- the change MUST be rejected

---

### DOC-9: Human Responsibility

AI tools are assistants, not authorities.

Humans are responsible for:
- reviewing all documentation changes
- rejecting unsafe modifications
- ensuring compliance with this policy

---

## Change Logging

### DOC-10: Mandatory Change Logs

All authoritative documents MUST maintain a change log.

The change log MUST record:
- date of change
- high-level description
- intent (addition / modification / removal)

---

## Fail-Safe Rule

### DOC-11: When in Doubt, Do Nothing

If a proposed documentation change:
- risks ambiguity
- risks data loss
- weakens constraints
- or is not clearly understood

The change MUST NOT be applied until clarified.

---

## Enforcement

Violations of this policy:
- invalidate the documentation change
- require review and rollback
- MUST be treated as blocking issues

This policy exists to **protect the integrity of the system**.

---

## Change Log Positioning

The **Change Log section** must always be the last section of authoritative documents.
No new content should follow the Change Log.

---

## Change Log

- 2026-01-17: Initial version.
- 2026-01-17: Added clarification that Change Log should always be the last section of a document.
